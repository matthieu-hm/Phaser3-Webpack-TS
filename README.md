# Generic Phaser3 project starter
#### Phaser 3 + Webpack + TypeScript

[Version ES6](https://github.com/sound-matt/Phaser3-Webpack-ES6)

# Setup
You’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/sound-matt/Phaser3-Webpack-TS.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you could install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

or if you choose yarn, just run ```yarn```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser.

## Build:

Run:

```npm run build```

This will simply build the game into ```./dist``` without lunching browserSync.


## Build for production:

Run:

```npm run build:production```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
